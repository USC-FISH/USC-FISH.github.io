**Hey! Does this all seem a bit technical? Check out our article in [Frontiers Young Minds](https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2019.00102) for an explanation of CRISPR immunity that should be accessible to all ages**

### Research: An Ongoing Battle Between Microbes and Their Viruses

Viruses that infect microbes severely impact their hostsâ€™ population and evolutionary dynamics. In an
ecological context, these viruses lead to the release of important nutrients back into the environment and
play a role in maintaining community-level diversity. In an evolutionary context, viruses drive the evolution
of host immune strategy, often leading to iterative co-evolutionary dynamics. In the microbial world these
two contexts are not distinct, with demographic and genetic changes occurring at similar rates, making
any separation of scales infeasible. This is especially true at the interface of viral-host interactions, where
the set of host defense and viral anti-defense strategies is diverse and fast-evolving. Extensive research has
profiled the diversity of host and viral communities, but we know relatively little about the distribution of
host defense and viral anti-defense strategies across environments. 

What drives selection favoring a particular defense strategy? What new defense systems are still waiting to
be discovered? How do defense systems coevolve with pathogens over time, and how does this coevolution
feed back into the dynamics of host-virus interactions? The central theme of my previous and ongoing
work is the application of tools from the fields of machine learning and complex systems science, alongside
more traditional approaches from population genetics and theoretical ecology, to understand the ecology and
evolution of antiviral defense strategies.

### Background and Education

*This March (2020) I'll be off to join the [Fuhrman Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/fuhrmanlab) at USC as a [Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Marine Microbial Ecology](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-marine-microbial-ecology/?tab=awardees)!*

I recently defended my PhD in [Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics  (BEES) at the University of Maryland College Park](https://www.bisi.umd.edu/bees-1) coadvised by [Philip LF Johnson](http://science.umd.edu/biology/plfj/) (population genetics) and [Bill Fagan](http://science.umd.edu/biology/faganlab/) (theoretical ecology). Right now I'm a [COMBINE network science fellow (NSF)](https://www.combine.umd.edu/), and I was previously a [GAANN fellow](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gaann/index.html) in mathematical biology (US Dept. Ed.).

I received a BA in mathematics and biology from [Bard College](https://www.bard.edu/) in 2015 with a [senior thesis](https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/senproj_s2015/39/) advised by [Bruce Robertson](https://www.bard.edu/faculty/details/?id=3226) (biology) and [Csilla Szabo](https://www.skidmore.edu/mathematics/faculty/szabo.php) (mathematics). 

I have previously worked under faculty at Bard College, the [Virginia Bioinformatics Institute](https://health.uconn.edu/laubenbacher/), the [Arizona State University Mathematics Department](https://math.la.asu.edu/~milner/welc_eng.html), and the [Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/dodelson.html).

I've also spent a decent amount of time involved in mathematics education, specifically the development of educational practices that engage rather than alienate young students of mathematics. I previously led the [Bard Math Circle](https://bardmathcircle.org/) and I have spent time working at the [Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics](https://www.beammath.org/). I still regularly volunteer as a mentor and reviewer for the [Student Spaceflight Experiments Program](http://ssep.ncesse.org/) and help organize the BEES program's annual Wildlife Quest activity for [Maryland Day](https://marylandday.umd.edu/).
