A little bit about who we are and what we do

## Who we are

## Holland Elder

My name is Holland (she/her). I am an evolutionary biologist and geneticist. In my research, I am most interested in understanding genetic diversity and adaptation of species that are the foundations of their ecosystems in order to conserve and restore these ecosystems in the face climate change. I became interested in biology, evolution, and genetics through contact with the natural world. My favorite ecosystems to explore when I was young were the sandy shores, rocky intertidal, and kelp forests of the U.S. west coast. I think everyone should have the opportunity that I had to explore and be curious in wild spaces, so I am also passionate about introducing everyone to the weird wonderful and beautiful biological diversity of these ecosystems.

## Jesse McNichol

My name is Jesse (he/him) and I study microorganisms found in the surface ocean and at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. My research helps understand how microorganisms evolved, where they can be found in thr world's oceans, and understanding how they contribute to the ecosystems that support us as inhabitants of the "pale blue dot" know as Earth. I am passionate about discovering, growing, and sequencing DNA from these tiny creatyures and got involved in this project because I want others to be able to experience this same excitement first-hand!

I am an environmental microbiologist who loves study the “unseen” microorganisms and what they do in creative ways and at multiple biological organization levels from micro- to global-scale. The ultimate puzzle that I try to answer is how and to what extent microorganisms matter to global nutrient cyclings by looking at their genetic composition and biological activities. I am also a soil scientist and marine biologist by training. Besides working in the lab and in front of my computer, being in the field is definitely what I enjoy doing.

**Bio:** I'm JL (they/them), a researcher at the University of Southern California trying to understand how bacteria grow and survive in the world around us. A big part of what I study is how bacteria fight viruses in the environment. Did you know that most viruses don't infect people? In fact, most viruses infect bacteria. I try to figure out how these bacteria protect themselves from viral infection in the wild.
