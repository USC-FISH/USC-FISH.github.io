**Bio:** JL is a researcher at the University of Southern California trying to understand how bacteria grow and survive in the world around us. JLâ€™s work includes bacteria that live in the ocean, but also in other places like the human gut. To study these bacteria, JL uses DNA to learn more what cells are doing, and what they could do if given the chance.
