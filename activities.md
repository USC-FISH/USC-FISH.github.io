## How do oceans move?

<img align="left" src="/img/tides.jpg" style="padding-right: 15px">

The ocean covers nearly 70% of the Earth’s surface and this huge, connected, body of water is constantly moving. Water, plants, animals, pollutants and people are carried by ocean movements. But have you ever wondered how the ocean moves? Dive deep into this exploration with this activity to learn together how temperature, salt and winds can influence the ocean movement.

## Think like a marine biologist

On land, plants make both the oxygen we breathe and food for us and all other life. Did you know that in the oceans a microscopic, “invisible forest” supports animals like whales and penguins? In this activity, you will learn about these microscopic plants called “phytoplankton”, why they are important to our planet, and use a real microscope (that you get to keep!) to observe and draw them yourself!

## Tidepool biodiversity

As you walk along the sea shore you might notice that there are lots of little animals that like to live where the water meets the land. In this activity we think about how animals survive in this constantly changing environment where the daily movement of the tides can make staying in one place a challenge. Come learn about California’s tide pools and their many residents!

## Mystery of the disappearing sea star

Sea stars are disappearing from the Pacific Coast. To find out why we will use the secrets held in their DNA. Come learn about why sea stars are important, what DNA is, how we can use it to help save the sea stars.
